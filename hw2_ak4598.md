This is an R Markdown file, rendered to github, that describes the
process for problems 1-3. The data used in each problem has already been
loaded into the project directory in the folder `data`.

# Problem 1

This problem uses FiveThiryEight data. We’ll use the data in
pols-month.csv, unemployment.csv, and snp.csv. Our goal is to merge
these into a single data frame using year and month as keys across
datasets.

``` r
pols <- read_csv(file = "data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv")
```

    ## Rows: 822 Columns: 9
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl  (8): prez_gop, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, prez_dem, gov_dem, sen_dem, r...
    ## date (1): mon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
unemployment <- read_csv(file = "data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv")
```

    ## Rows: 68 Columns: 13
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (13): Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
snp <- read_csv(file = "data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv")
```

    ## Rows: 787 Columns: 2
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): date
    ## dbl (1): close
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

## Problem 1.1

Clean the data in `pols-month.csv`. Use separate() to break up the
variable `mon` into integer variables `year`, `month`, and `day`;
replace month number with month name; create a `president` variable
taking values `gop` and `dem`, and remove `prez_dem` and `prez_gop`; and
remove the `day` variable.

``` r
pols <- pols %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "mon", "day"), sep = "-", convert = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(mon = month.abb[mon],
         president = ifelse(prez_dem>0,"dem",
                            ifelse(prez_gop>0,"gop",
                                   NA))) %>%
  select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day)
```

## Problem 1.2

Second, clean the data in `snp.csv` using a similar process to the
above. For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and
month, and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.

``` r
snp <- snp %>%
  separate(date, into = c("mon", "day", "year"), sep = "/", convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(mon = month.abb[mon],
         year = as.integer(ifelse(year<16,year+2000,year+1900))) %>%
  arrange(year, mon) %>%
  relocate(year, mon) %>%
  select(-day)
```

## Problem 1.3

Third, tidy the `unemployment` data so that it can be merged with the
previous datasets. This process will involve switching from “wide” to
“long” format; ensuring that key variables have the same name; and
ensuring that key variables take the same values.

``` r
unemployment <- unemployment %>%
  pivot_longer(Jan:Dec,
               names_to = "mon",
               values_to = "unemployment") %>%
  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year)) %>%
  clean_names()
```

## Problem 1.4

Join the datasets by merging `snp` into `pols`, and merging
`unemployment` into the result.

``` r
pols_data <- pols %>%
  left_join(snp, by = c("year", "mon")) %>%
  left_join(unemployment, by = c("year", "mon"))
```

In this problem, we took three datasets and created one long-format
dataset organized by month and year.

The original `pols` dataset had 822 observations (rows) and 9 variables
(columns). We split the date variable into `mon` and `year` to arrange
the dataset. We also created the `president` variable to reflect whether
the president was republican or democrat.

The original `snp` dataset had 787 observations (rows) and 2 variables
(columns). We again split the date variable into `mon` and `year` to
arrange the dataset.

The original `unemployment` dataset had 68 observations (rows) and 13
variables (columns). We reorganized this dataset from wide format to
long format so that months were in one column instead of spread across
columns - now the `mon` variable to match the other datasets.

The `snp` and `unemployment` datasets were merged into the `pols`
dataset to create the `pols_data` dataset. This final dataset includes
the `close` variable and the `unemployment` variable, matched to the
month-year.

# Problem 2

This problem uses Mr. Trash Wheel data. Below we import and clean the
data for each trash wheel. The two main changes in each dataset is
adding a variable `wheel` that reflects the specific trash wheel name,
and updating the `homes_powered` variable to estimate the number of
homes powered for any dumpster-date record that has a weight in tons of
trash collected.

## 1. Mr. Trash Wheel

``` r
mr <- read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
                 sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
                 range = "A2:N586") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(wheel = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
         homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30) %>%
  relocate(wheel, dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, homes_powered)
```

## 2. Professor Trash Wheel

``` r
professor <- read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
                 sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel",
                 range = "A2:M108") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(wheel = "Professor Trash Wheel",
         homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30,
         year = as.character(year)) %>%
  relocate(wheel, dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, homes_powered)
```

## 3. Gwynnda

``` r
gwynnda <- read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
                 sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel",
                 range = "A2:L157") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(wheel = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel",
         homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30,
         year = as.character(year)) %>%
  relocate(wheel, dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, homes_powered)
```

## 4. Combine trash wheels

``` r
trash <- 
  bind_rows(mr, professor, gwynnda)
```

The trash dataset for Mr. Trash Wheel had 584 observations of
dumpster-dates (rows) and 15 variables (columns). The trash dataset for
Professor Trash Wheel had 106 observations of dumpster-dates (rows) and
14 variables (columns). The trash dataset for Gwynnda Trash Wheel had
155 observations of dumpster-dates (rows) and 13 variables (columns).
After appending these three datasets, each reflecting dumpster-date data
for a specific trash wheel, we end up with 845 total observations.

The key variables include `wheel` (name of one of the three wheels),
`dumpster` (the dumpster number where trash was deposited),
`weight_tons` (the weight of the trash collected at that dumpster on
that date), and `homes_powered` (the estimated number of homes that
could be powered by the amount of trash collected at that dumpster on
that date).

Of note, the total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel
was 216 tons. The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda
in July 2021 was 16,300.

# Problem 3

This problem uses Alzeihmer’s disease (AD) biomarker data from the MCI
dataset. The data are organized into 1) baseline demographic data and 2)
longitudinally observed biomarker values.

## Baseline demographics

First, import and tidy the data. We only import data after the first
row, since the first row includes value codes not variable names. We
also convert all “.” values to `NA`.

``` r
baseline <- read_csv("data/data_mci/MCI_baseline.csv", 
                     skip = 1,
                     na = ".") %>%
  clean_names() 
```

    ## Rows: 483 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (6): ID, Current Age, Sex, Education, apoe4, Age at onset
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Ensure that sex and APOE4 carrier status are appropriate encoded
(i.e. not numeric). We used the value codes in the first row of the csv
file to encode the two variables.

``` r
baseline <- baseline %>%
  mutate(sex = case_when(
    sex == 1 ~ "Male",
    sex == 0 ~ "Female"),
    apoe4 = case_when(apoe4 == 1 ~ "Carrier",
                      apoe4 == 0 ~ "Non-carrier"))
```

Remove any participants who do not meet the stated inclusion criteria
(i.e. no MCI at baseline). To do this, we excluded those participants
whose age at MCI onset is equal to or lesser than their age at baseilne.
Since `NA` values signify that the participant never acquired MCI, these
should be included.

``` r
baseline_eligible <- baseline %>%
  filter((age_at_onset != current_age & age_at_onset > current_age) | is.na(age_at_onset))
```

4 participants were not eligible for the study because they acquired MCI
before baseline. These were excluded from the `baseline` dataset to
create the new `baseline_eligible` dataset. A total of 479 participants
were recruited and eligible, and 93 developed MCI (they had a
non-missing value for `age_at_onset`). The average baseline age is
65.03, and 30% of women are APOE4 carriers.

## Longitudinal biomarkers

Import and tidy the data. We skipped the first because it contained
value codes not variable names. We also renamed `study_id` to `id` to
match the `baseline dataset`.

``` r
biomarkers <- read_csv("data/data_mci/mci_amyloid.csv", 
                       skip = 1) %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  rename(id = study_id)
```

    ## Rows: 487 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (5): Baseline, Time 2, Time 4, Time 6, Time 8
    ## dbl (1): Study ID
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

This dataset contains 42/40 ratio important for predicting and
diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease. The ratio values are organized by time
point in the follow up period: from `baseline` to `time_8`. There are 5
time point measurements of the ratio, and the dataset consists of 487
participants.

## Compare

Combine the demographic and biomarker datasets so that only participants
who appear in both datasets are retained.

``` r
df <- baseline_eligible %>% inner_join(biomarkers, by = "id") 
```

When merging the two, 471 participants were found in both baseline and
biomarker datsets. 8 participants were found in only the baseline or
biomarker datasets.

The final dataset now has 11 columns. The dataset is exported to a CSV
to the data/data_mci directory.

``` r
write_csv(df, "data/data_mci/merged.csv")
```
